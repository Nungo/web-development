This is a web development project as part of my virtual internship at Codsoft
This is specifically a landing page where I played around with html and css to showcase my skills in a creative manner of creating a visually appealing landing page
I chose to create a property landing page that showcases dream houses
My html was mostly a basic structure of div classes, h1, p tags and a footer tag.
The real skillset challenge for me was the styling. It was a challenge paying attention to positioning, widths, heights and alignments but I am pleased to see how far I came to a successful landing page.
