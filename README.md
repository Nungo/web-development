This project is a tribute to the iconic supermodel, philanthropist, and cultural trailblazer, Naomi Campbell. Using HTML and CSS, I created a visually appealing and informative webpage that highlights her life, career milestones, achievements, and influence. The page features a career timeline, a gallery of her most memorable moments, a collection of her major awards, and quotes from influential figures celebrating her impact. Through this project, I learned to organize content effectively, enhance storytelling with creative design elements, and balance aesthetics with factual accuracy. This tribute reflects both my admiration for Naomi Campbell and the skills I developed in web design and content presentation.
