            <p> Dynamic Full Stack Developer with a specialized focus in Salesforce ecosystem
                development and web technologies. Currently advancing innovative solutions at
                LORTechnologies while pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computing.
                Demonstrates expertise in building responsive applications using Vue.js, Node.js,
                and PostgreSQL, alongside strong Salesforce administration capabilities in
                automation and CRM optimization. Proficient in Python, JavaScript, and C#, with
                a proven ability to translate complex business requirements into elegant technical
                solutions.
                My passion extends beyond coding. I'm deeply involved in initiatives that help
                bring technology education to underserved communities, with a special focus on
                mentoring aspiring women developers. I believe in building technology that not
                only drives business success but also opens doors for others, particularly those
                who might not traditionally have access to tech opportunities</p>

            <img src="images/data-visualizationpng.png" alt="Project 1">
            <p> You've been hired to come in as a data analyst working for Delta Airlines. Delta Airlines is struggling to maintain its competitive edge amidst the increasing presence of low-cost carriers and high regulatory pressures. The airline's current data is siloed, making it difficult to solve customer issues effectively and devise a robust business strategy. Additionally, the 2024 Crowdstrike Incidents have added complexity to their data security and management needs. Delta's objective is to assimilate its data, leveraging AI and CRM solutions to gain comprehensive insights. This will enable them to implement a solid 5 year business strategy that addresses market dynamics and regulatory requirements and keep their competitive edge in the industry.</p>

            <img src="images/food-inventory.webp" alt="Project 2">
            <p>Develop a full-stack application for a chef in a Kota shop to manage food inventory efficiently. The app should allow the chef to add, update, and delete food items, with a dashboard on the front end displaying current inventory levels. It must include user registration and login features. For the front end, use Vite, Vue 3 Composition API, Pinia, Vue Router, and Tailwind CSS. The backend should be built with Hono.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL and Drizzle ORM for database management. </p>
